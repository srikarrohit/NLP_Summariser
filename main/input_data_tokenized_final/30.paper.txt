Resource Description Framework -LRB- RDF -RRB- triplestores and Property
Graph -LRB- PG -RRB- database systems are two approaches for data management that are based on modeling storing and querying graph-like data .
Given the heterogeneity between these systems it becomes necessary
to develop methods to allow interoperability among them . While there
exist some approaches to exchange data and schema between RDF and
PG databases they lack compatibility and even a solid formal foundation . In this paper we study the semantic interoperability between
RDF and PG databases . Specifically we present two direct mappings
-LRB- schema-dependent and schema-independent -RRB- for transforming an RDF
database into a PG database . We show that the proposed mappings
possess the fundamental properties of semantics preservation and information preservation . The existence of both mappings allows us to
conclude that the PG data model subsumes the expressiveness or information capacity of the RDF data model .

RDF and Graph databases are two approaches for data management
that are based on modeling storing and querying graph-like data . The
database systems based on these models are gaining relevance in the industry
due to their use in various application domains where complex data analytics
is required -LSB- 2 -RSB- . RDF triplestores and graph database systems are tightly connected as
they are based on graph data models . RDF databases are based on the RDF
data model -LSB- 21 -RSB- their standard query language is SPARQL and RDF
Schema -LSB- 8 -RSB- allows to describe classes of resources and properties -LRB- i.e. the
data schema -RRB- . On the other hand most graph databases are based on the
Property Graph -LRB- PG -RRB- data model there is no standard query language and
there is no standard notion of property graph schema . Therefore RDF
and PG database systems are dissimilar in data model schema constraints
and query language .

In this article we have presented two mappings to transform RDF databases
into Property Graph databases . We have shown that both database mappings satisfy the property of information preservation i.e. there exist inverse
mappings that allow recovering the original databases without losing information . These results allow us to present the following conclusion about the
information capacity of the Property Graph data models with respect to the
RDF data model .
