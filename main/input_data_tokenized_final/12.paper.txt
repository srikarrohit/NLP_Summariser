Ontology mediated query answering -LRB- OMQA -RRB- is a paradigm that generalizes the traditional database querying by enriching the database with a domain ontology PoggiLCGLR08 . This paradigm has played an important role in the semantic web calvanese : DL-lite2007 lutz : ijcai05 data modelling BerardiCG05 data exchange FKMP05 and data integration Lenzerini02 and has recently emerged as one of the ce tral issues in knowledge representation as well as in databases .

A long-term major topic for OMQA is to identify proper languages that specify ontologies . There have been a large number of ontology languages proposed for OMQA since the m d 2000s . For instance in description logics the DL-Lite family calvanese : DL-lite2007 EL-family lutz : ijcai05 and other variants have been proposed and extensively studied . More recently the Datalog family a.k.a. existential rule languages or dependencies in databases have been rediscovered as promising languages for OMQA see e.g. BLMS11 CaliGL12 CaliGP12 . Most of these languages enjoy good computational properties such as the first-order rewritability or PTIME data complexity .

While all these languages a e of their specific features and hence are useful in different applications it is not realistic to implement OMQA-sys ems for all of them . So a natural question arises : Can we find the largest one -LRB- in the expressiveness -RRB- among the family of first-order rewritable -LRB- or PTIME-tractable -RRB- OMQA-languages ? Let us call the largest language in the above sense a universal language . Clearly it is of great theoretical and practical importance to identify the existence of universal language w.r.t. some kind of tractability which is also the main task of this paper .

It is worth noting that the universality is one of the major principles for designing languages in both computer science and logic . For example almost all the traditional programming languages including C Java and Prolog are known to e universal for the f mily of Turing complete programming languages ; propositional logic can express all boolean functions ; and by the well-known Lindstr m theorem the first order logic is the largest one among the logics that enjoy both the compactness and the L wenheim-Skolem property ; see e.g. EbbinghuasFT1994 . In databases first-order language is shown to be universal for the family of query languages with data complexity in | | SYMBOLTOKEN | | and Datalog universal for the family of query languages with data complexity in PTIME ; see e.g. Immerman99 .

Some recent work in OMQA has been done along the line of identifying universal languages . C lvaneseGLLR13 CalvaneseGLLR13 proved that under a certain syntactic classification some lang ages in the DLLite family are the maximal fragments of description logic with the first-order rewritability . By regarding OMQA as traditional database querying GRS2014 GRS2014 showed that weakly-guarded tuple-generating dependencies -LRB- TGDs -RRB- capture the class o EXPTIME queries ; RudolphT2015 RudolphT2015 proved hat general TGDs capture the class of recursively enumerable queries . In the setting of schema mapping ZhangZY15 ZhangZY15 showed that the language of weakly-acyclic TGDs is universal for languages of TGDs with finite semi-oblivious chase . All of these results shed new insights on understanding the expressiveness of existential rules but it is worth noting that OMQA is significantly different from both traditional database querying and schema mapping . To understand the expressiveness in the framework of OMQA ZhangZY16 ZhangZY16 proved that the language of disjunctive embedded dependencies is universal for the family of recursively enumerable OMQA-languages . Along this line this paper will focus on tractable OMQA .

Aimed at exploiting universal languages for the tractable OMQA in this paper we focus on three families of OMQA-languages including first-order rewritable languages and languages whose data complexity is in | | SYMBOLTOKEN | | or PTIME . Our contributions are summarized as follows . On one hand we prove that there is in general no universal language for each of the above families of languages . On the other hand by restricting the number of database constants involved in query answering we propose a novel property called the locality to approximate the first-order rewritability and identify the existence of universal language for the family of local OMQA-languages . All of these results hold for OMQA with query languages such as conjunctive queries unions of conjunctive queries and acyclic conjunctive queries .
