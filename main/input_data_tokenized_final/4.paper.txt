Compositional reasoning in terms of objects relations and actions is a central ability in human cognition spelke2007core . This ability serves as a core motivation behind a range of recent works that aim at enriching machine learning models with the ability to disentangle scenes into objects their properties and relations between them chang2016compositional battaglia2016interaction watters2017visual van2018relational kipf2018neural sun2018actor sun2019relational xu2019unsupervised . These structured neural models greatly facilitate predicting physical dynamics and the consequences of actions and provide a strong inductive bias for generalization to novel environment situations allowing models to answer counterfactual questions such as `` What would happen if I pushed this block instead of pulling it ? '' .

Arriving at a structured description of the world in terms of objects and relations in the first place however is a challenging problem . While most methods in this area require some form of human annotation for the extraction of objects or relations several recent works study the problem f object discovery from visual data in a completely unsupervised or self-supervised manner eslami2016attend greff2017neural nash2017multi van2018relational kosiorek2018sequential janner2018reasoning xu2019unsupervised burgess2019monet greff2019multi engelcke2 19genesis . These methods follow a generative approach i.e. they learn to discover object-based representations by performing visual predictions or reconstruction and by optimizing an objective in pixel space . Placing a loss in pixe space requires carefully trading off structural constraints on latent variables vs. accuracy of pixel-based reconstruction . Typical failure modes include ignoring visually small but relevant features for predicting the future such as a bullet in an Atari game kaiser2019model or wasting model capacity on visually rich but otherwise potentially irrelevant features such as static backgrounds .

To avoid such failure modes we propose to adopt a discriminative approach using contrastive learning which scores real against fake experiences in the form of state-action-state triples from an experience buffer lin1992self in a similar fashion as typical graph embedding approaches score true facts in the form of entity-relation-entity triples against corrupted triples or fake facts .

We introduce Contrastively-trained S ructured World Models -LRB- C-SWMs -RRB- a class of models for learning abstract state representations from observations in an environment . C-SWMs learn a set of abstract state variables one for each object in a particular observation . Environment transitions are modeled using a graph neural network scarselli2009graph li2015gated kipf20 6semi gilmer2017neural battaglia2018relationa that operates on latent abstract representations .

This paper further introduces a novel object-level contrastive loss for unsupervised learning of object-based representations . We arrive at this formulation by adapting methods for learning translational graph embeddings bordes2013translating wang2014knowledge to our use case . By establishing a connection between contrastive learning of state abstractions franccois2018combined thomas2018disentangling and relational graph emb ddings nickel2016review we hope to prov de inspiration and uidance for future model improvements in both fields .

In a set of experiments where we use a novel ranking-based evaluation strategy we demonstrate that C-SWMs learn interpretable object-level state abstractions accurately learn to predict state transitions many steps into the future demonstra e combinatorial generalization to novel environment configurations and learn to identify objects fro scenes without supervision .

Learning such a structured world model from raw sensory data remains a challenge

C-SWMs utilize a contrastive approach for representation learning in environments with compositional structure
@label
We structure each state embedding as a set of object representations and their relations modeled by a graph neural network
@label
This allows objects to be discovered from raw pixel observations without direct supervision as part of the learning process
@label
We evaluate C-SWMs on compositional environments involving multiple interacting objects that can be manipulated independently by an agent simple Atari games and a multi-object physics simulation

Our experiments demonstrate that C-SWMs can overcome limitations of models based on pixel reconstruction and outperform typical representatives of this model class in highly structured environments while learning interpretable object-based representations
