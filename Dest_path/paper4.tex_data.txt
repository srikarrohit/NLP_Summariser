This ability serves as a core motivation behind a range of recent works that aim at enriching machine learning models with the ability to disentangle scenes into objects, their properties, and relations between them  chang2016compositional,battaglia2016interaction,watters2017visual,van2018relational,kipf2018neural,sun2018actor,sun2019relational,xu2019unsupervised. These structured neural models greatly facilitate predicting physical dynamics and the consequences of actions, and provide a strong inductive bias for generalization to novel environment situations, allowing models to answer counterfactual questions such as \"What would happen if I pushed this block instead of pulling it?\".\r\n\r\nArriving at a structured description of the world in terms of objects and relations in the first place, however, is a challenging problem. While most methods in this area require some form of human annotation for the extraction of objects or relations, several recent works study the problem  f object discovery from visual data in a completely unsupervised or self-supervised manner eslami2016attend,greff2017neural,nash2017multi,van2018relational,kosiorek2018sequential,janner2018reasoning,xu2019unsupervised,burgess2019monet,greff2019multi,engelcke2 19genesis. These methods follow a generative approach, i.e., they learn to discover object-based representations by performing visual predictions or reconstruction and by optimizing an objective in pixel space. Placing a loss in pixe  space requires carefully trading off structural constraints on latent variables vs. accuracy of pixel-based reconstruction. Typical failure modes include ignoring visually small, but relevant features for predicting the future, such as a bullet in an Atari game kaiser2019model, or wasting model capacity on visually rich, but otherwise potentially irrelevant features, such as static backgrounds.\r\n\r\nTo avoid such failure modes, we propose to adopt a discriminative approach using contrastive learning, which scores real against fake experiences in the form of state-action-state triples from an experience buffer lin1992self, in a similar fashion as typical graph embedding approaches score true facts in the form of entity-relation-entity triples against corrupted triples or fake facts.\r\n\r\nWe introduce Contrastively-trained S ructured World Models (C-SWMs), a class of models for learning abstract state representations from observations in an environment. C-SWMs learn a set of abstract state variables, one for each object in a particular observation. Environment transitions are modeled using a graph neural network scarselli2009graph,li2015gated,kipf20 6semi,gilmer2017neural,battaglia2018relationa  that operates on latent abstract representations.\r\n\r\nThis paper further introduces a novel object-level contrastive loss for unsupervised learning of object-based representations. We arrive at this formulation by adapting methods for learning translational graph embeddings bordes2013translating,wang2014knowledge to our use case. By establishing a connection between contrastive learning of state abstractions franccois2018combined,thomas2018disentangling and relational graph emb ddings nickel2016review, we hope to prov de inspiration and  uidance for future model improvements in both fields.\r\n\r\nIn a set of experiments, where we use a novel ranking-based evaluation strategy, we demonstrate that C-SWMs learn interpretable object-level state abstractions, accurately learn to predict state transitions many steps into the future, demonstra e combinatorial generalization to novel environment configurations and learn to identify objects fro  scenes without supervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n", {}], "Structured World Models": ["\r\nOur goal is to learn an object-oriented abstraction of a particular observation or environment state.

Colored blocks denote abstract states for a particular object. \r\n\r\n\r\nEncode  and Object Extractor\r\nWe split the encoder into two separate modules: 1) a CNN-based object extractor ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| and 2) an MLP-based object encoder ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| The object extractor module is a CNN operating directly on image-based observations from the environment with K feature maps in its last layer. Each feature map ||MATHEQUATION|| can be interpreted as an object mask corresponding to one particular object slot, where ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| denotes selection of the k-th feature map. For simplicity, we only assign a single feature map per object slot which sufficed for the experiments considered in this work (see Appendix ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| To allow for encoding of more complex object features (other than, e.g., position/velocity), the object extractor can be adapted to produce multiple feature maps per object slot. After the object extractor module, we flatten each feature map ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| (object mask) and feed it into the object encoder ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| The object encoder shares weights across objects and returns an abstract state representation: ||MATHEQUATION|| with ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| We set ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| R^D in the following, where D is a hyperparameter.\r\n\r\nRelational Transition Model\r\nWe implement the transition model as a graph neural network scarselli2009graph,li2015gated,kipf2016semi,battaglia2016interaction,gilmer2017neural,battaglia2018relational, which allows us to model pairwise interactions between object states while being invariant to the order in which objects are represented. After the encoder stage, we have an abstract state description ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| and an action ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| for every object in the scene. We represent actions as one-hot vectors (or a vector of zeros if no action is applied to a particular object), but note that other choices are possible, e.g., for continuous action spaces. The transition function then takes as input the tuple of object representations ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| ..., ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| and actions ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| ..., ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| at a particular time ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| a_t) ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| ||SYMBOLTOKEN||  ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| a_t) is implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that takes ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| as input node features.

This corresponds to a single round of node-to-edge and edge-to-node message pa sing. Alternatively, one could apply multiple rounds of message passing, but we did not find this to be necessary for the experiments considered in this work. Note that this update rule corresponds to message passing on a fully-connected scene graph, which is ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| This can be reduced to linear complexity by reducing connectivity to nearest neighbors in the abstract state space, which we leave for future work.

We further discuss related work on relational graph embeddings in Section ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| Models of Environments\r\nRecent work on modeling structured environments such as interacting multi-object or multi-agent systems has made great strides in improving predictive accuracy by explicitly taking into account the structured nature of such systems sukhbaatar2016learning,chang2016compositional,battaglia2016interaction,watte s2017visual,hoshen2017vain,wang2018nervenet,van2018relational,kipf2018neural,sanchez2018graph,xu2019unsupervised  These methods generally make use of some form of graph neural network, where node update functions model the dynamics of individual objects, parts or agents and edge update functions model their int ractions and relations. Several recent works succeed in learning such structured models directly from pixels watters2017visual,van2018relational,xu2019unsupervised,watters2019cobra, but in contrast to our work rely on pixel-based loss functions. The latest example in this line of research is the COBRA model watters2019cobra, which learns an action-conditioned transition policy on object representations obtained from an unsupervised object discovery model burgess2019monet. Unlike C-SWM, COBRA does not model interactions between object slots and relies on a pixel-based loss for training. Our object encoder, however, is mo e limited and utilizing an iterative object encoding process such as in MONet burgess2019monet would be interesting for future work.\r\n\r\nContrastive Learning\r\nContrastive learning m thods are widely used in the field of graph representation learning bordes2013translating,perozzi2014deepwalk,grover2016node2vec,bordes2013translating,schlichtkrull2018modeling,velivckovic2018deep, and for learning word representations mnih2012fast,mikolov2013efficient. The main idea is to construct pairs of related data examples (positive examples, e.g., connected by an edge in a graph or co-occuring words in a sentence) and pairs of unrelated or corrupted data examples (negative examples), and use a loss function that scores positive and negative pairs in a different way. Most energy-based losses lecun2006tutorial are suitable for this task. Recent works oord2018representation,hjelm2018learning,henaff2019data,sun2019contrastive,anand2019unsupervised connect objectives of this kind to the principle of learning representations by maximizing mutual information between data and learned representations, and successfully apply these methods to image, speech, and video data. \n\r\nState Representation Learning State representation learning in environments similar to ours is often approached by models based on autoencoders corneil2018efficient, watter2015embed, ha2018world, hafner2018learning, laversanne2018curiosity or via adversarial learning kurutach2018learning, wang2019learning. Some recent methods learn state representations without requiring a decoder back into pixel space. Examples include the selectivity objective in thomas201 disentangling, the contrastive objective in franccois2018combined, the distribution matching objective in gelada2019deepmdp or using causality-based losses and physical priors in latent space jonschkowski2015learning,ehrhardt2018unsupervised. Most notably, eh hardt2018unsupervised propose a method to learn an object detection module and a physics module jointly from raw video data without pixel-based losses. This approach, however, can only track a single object at a  ime and requires careful balancing of multiple loss functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n", {}], "Experiments": ["\r\nOur goal of this experimental section is to verify whether C-SWMs can 1) learn to discover object representations from environment interactions without supervision, 2) learn an accurate transition model in latent space, and 3) generalize to novel, unseen scenes. Our implementation is available under ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| evaluate C-SWMs on two novel grid world environments (2D shapes and 3D blocks) involving multiple interacting objects that can be manipulated independently by an agent, two Atari 2600 games (Atari Pong and Space Invaders), and a multi-object physics simulation (3-body physics). See Figure ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| for example observations.\r\n\r\nFor all environments, we use a random policy to collect experience for both training and evaluation. Observations are provided as 50\u00d750\u00d73 color images for the grid world environments and as 50\u00d750\u00d76 tensors (two concatenated consecutive frames) for the Atari and 3-body physics environments.

Best viewed in color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", {"Evaluation Metrics": ["\r\nIn order to evaluate model performance directly in latent space, we make use of ranking metrics, which are commonly used for the evaluation of link prediction models, as in, e.g., bordes2013translating. This allows us to assess the quality of learned representations directly without relying on auxiliary metrics such as pixel-based reconstruction losses, or performance in downstream tasks such as planning.\r\n\r\nGiven an observation encoded by the model and an action, we use the model to predict the representation of the next state, reached after taking the action in the environment. This predicted state representation is then compared to the encoded true observation after taking the action in the environment and a set of reference states (observations encoded by the model) obtained from t e experience buffer. We measu e and report both Hits at Rank 1 (H@1) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Additional details on these evaluation metrics can be found in Appendix ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| World Models The predominant method for state representation learning is based on autoencoders, and often on the VAE kingma2013auto,rezende 014stochastic model in particular. This World Model baseline is inspired by ha2018world and uses either a deterministic autoencoder (AE) or a VAE to learn state representations. Finally, an MLP is used to predict the next state after taking an action.\r\n\r\nPhysics As Inverse Graphics (PAIG) This model by jaques2019physics is based on an encoder-decoder architecture and trained with pixel-based reconstruction losses, but uses a differentiable physics engine in the latent space that operates on explicit position and velocity representations for each object. Thus, this model is only applicable to th  3body physics environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n", {}], "Training and Evaluation Setting": ["\r\nWe train C-SWMs on an experience buffer obtained by running a random policy on the respective environment. We choose 1000 episodes with 100 environment steps each for the grid world environments, 1000 episodes with 10 steps each for the Atari environments and 5000 episodes with 10 steps each fo  the 3body physics environment.\r\n\r\nFor evaluation, we populate a separate experience buffer with 10 environment steps per episode and a total of 10.000 episodes for the grid world environments, 100 episodes for the Atari environments and 1000 episodes for the physics environment. For the Atari environments, we minimize train/test overlap by `warm-starting' experience collection in these environments with random actions before we start populating the experience buffer (see Appendix ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| and we ensure that not a single full test set episode coincides exactly with an episode from the training set. The state spaces of the grid world environments are large (approx. 6.4M unique states) and hence train/test coincidence of a full 10-step episode is unlikely. Overlap is similarly unlikely for the physics environment which has a continuous  tate space. Hence, performing well on these tasks will require some form of generalization to new environment configurations or an unseen sequence of s ates and actions.\r \r\nAll models are trained for 100 epochs (200 for Atari games) using the Adam kingma2014adam optimizer with a learning rate of 5\u00b7 ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| and a batch size of 1024 (512 for baselines with decoders due to higher memory demands,  nd 100 for PAIG as suggested by the authors). Model architecture details are provided in Appendix ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| Results\r\n\r\n\r\nWe present qualitative results for the grid world environments in Figure ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| and for the 3-body physics environment in Figure ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| All results are obtained on hold-out test data. Further qualitative results (incl. on Atari games) can be found in Appendix ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| the grid world environments, we can observe that C-SWM reliably discovers object-specific filters for a particular scene, without direct supervision. Further, each object is represented by two coordinates which correspond (up to a rando  linear transformation) to the true object position in t e scene. Although we choose a two-dimensional latent representation per object for easier visualization, we find that results remain unchanged if we increase the dimensionality of the latent representation. The edges in this learned abstract transition graph correspond to the effect of a particular action applied to the object. The structure of the learned latent representation accurately captures the underlying grid structure of the environment. We further find that the transition model, which only has access to latent representations, correctly captures whether an action has an effect or not, e.g., if a neighboring position is blocked by another object.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we find that the model can learn object-specific encoders in the 3-body physics environment and can learn object-specific latent representations that track location and velocity of a particular object, while learning an accurate latent transition model that generalizes well to unseen environment instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", {}], "Quantitative Results": ["\r\nWe set up quantitative experiments for evaluating the quality of both object discovery and the quality of the learned transition model. We compare against autoencoder baselines and model variants that do not represent the environment in an object-factorized manner, do not use a GNN, or do not make use of contrastive learning. Performing well under this evaluation setting requires some degree of (combinatorial) generalization to unseen environment instances.\r\n\r\nWe report ranking scores (in %) in latent space, after encoding source and target observations, and taking steps in the latent space using the learned model. Reported results are mean and standard error of scores over 4 runs on hold-out environment instances. Results are summarized in Table ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| results for multi-step prediction in latent space. Highest (mean) scores in bold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find that baselines that make use of reconstruction losses in pixel space (incl. the C-SWM model variant without contrastive loss) typically generalize less well to unseen scenes and learn a latent space configuration tha  makes it difficult for the transition model to learn the correct transition function. See Appendix ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| for a visual analysis of such latent state transition graphs. This effect appears to be even stronger when using a VAE-based World Model, where the prior puts further constraints on the latent representations. C-SWM recovers thi  structure well, see Fig re ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| the grid-world environments (2D shapes and 3D blocks), C-SWM models latent transitions almos  perfectly, which requires taking interactions between latent representations of objects into account. Removing the interaction component, i.e., replacing the latent GNN with an object-wise MLP, makes the model insensitive to pairwise interactions and hence the ability to predict future states deteriorates. Similarly, if we remove the state factorization, the model has difficulties generalizing to unseen environment configurations.  e furth r explore variants of the gri world environments in Appendix ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| wher  1) certain actions have no effect, and 2) one object moves randomly and independent of agent actions, to test the robustness of our approach.\r\n\r\nFor the Atari 2600 experiments, we find that results can have a high variance, and that the ta k is more difficult, as both the World Model baseline and C-SWM struggle to make perfect long-term predictions. While for Space Invaders, a large number of object slots || YMBOLTOKEN|| appears to be beneficial, C-SWM achieves best results with only a single object slot in Atari Pong. This suggests that one should determine the optimal value of K based on performance on a validation set if it is not known a-priori. Using an iterative object encoding mechanism, such as in MONet burgess2019monet, would enable the model to assign `empty' slots which could improve robustness w.r.t. the choice of K, which we leave for future work.\r\n\r\nWe find that both C-SWMs and the autoencoder-based World Model baseline excel at short-term predictions in the 3-body physics environment, with C-SWM having a slight edge in the 10 step prediction setting. Under our evaluation setting, the PAIG baseline jaques2019physics underperforms using the hyperparameter setting recommended by the authors. Note that we do not tune hyperparameters of C-SWM separately for this task and use the same settings as in other environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n", {}]}], "Conclusions": ["\r\nStructured world models offer compelling advantages over pure connectionist methods, by enabling stronger inductive biases for generalization, without necessarily constraining the generality of the model: for example, the contrastively trained model on the 3-body physics environment is free to store identical representations in each object slot and ignore pairwise interactions, i.e., an unstructured world model still exists as a special case. Experimentally, we find that C-SWMs make effective use of this additional structure, likely because it allows for a transition model of significantly lower complexity, and learn object-oriented models that generalize better to unseen situations.\r\n\r\nWe are excited about the prospect of using C-SWMs for model-based planning and reinforcement learning in future work, where object-oriented representations will likely allow for more accurate counterfactual reasoning about effects of actions and novel interactions in the environment. We further hope to inspire future work to think beyond autoencoder-based approaches for object-based, structured representation learning, and to address some of the limitations outlined in this paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n", {}], "Acknowledgements": ["\r\nWe would like to thank Marco Federici and Adam Kosiorek\r\nfor helpful discussions.

We apply the same visualization technique to the model variant without contrastive loss, which is instead trained with a decoder model and a loss in pixel space. See Figure ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| for this baseline and note that the regular structure in the latent space is lost, which makes it difficult for the transition model to learn transitions which generalize to unseen environment instances.\r\n\r\n\r\nQualitative results for the 3-body physics dataset are summarized in Figures ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| and ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| for two different random seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Atari 2600 environments, we generally found latent object representations to be less interpretable. We attribute this to the fact that a) objects have different roles and are in gene al not exchangeable (in contrast to the block pushing grid world environments and the 3-body physics environment), b) actions affect only one object directly, but many other objects indirectly in two conse utive frames, and c) due to multiple objects in one scene sharing the same visual features.

This requires training a separate decoder model for C-SWM. For fairness of this comparison, we use the same protocol to train a separate decoder for the World Model (AE) baseline (discarding the one obtained from the original end-to end autoencoding training procedure). This decoder has the same architecture as in the other baseline models and is trained for 100 ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| g r a p h i c s ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| model comparison in pixel space on a  oldout test set of the 2D shapes environment.

Although the World Model (AE) baseline makes clear mistakes which compound over time, it nonetheless often gets several object positions correct after many time steps. The ranking loss in latent space captures this behaviour well, and, for example, assigns an almost perfect score for 1-step prediction to the Worl  Model (AE) baseline. The typically used mean-squared error (MSE) in pixel space (see Figure ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| however, differs by several orders of magnitude between the two models and does not capture any of the nuanced differences in qualitative predictive behavior.

This mirrors the setting present in many Atari 2600 benchmark environments that have an explicit no-op actio .\r\nIn the second variant, termed random object, we assign a special property to one out of the five objects: a random action is applied to this object at every turn, i.e., the agent only has control over the other four objects and in every environment step, a total of two objects receive an action (one by the agent, which only affects one out of the first four objects, and one random action on the last object). This is to test how the model behaves in the presence of other agents that act randomly. As our model is fully deterministic, it is to be expected th t adding a source of randomness in the environment will pose a challenge.\r\n\r\nWe report results in Table ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| Reported numbers are mean and standard error over 4 runs on hold-out environment instances.

The action one-hot vector encodes the directional movement action applied to a particular object, or is represented as a vector of zeros if no action is applied to a particular object. Note that only a single object receives an action per time step. For the Atari environments, we provide a copy of the one-hot encoded action vector to every object slot, and for the 3-body physics environment, which has no ac ions, we do not provide an action vector.\r\n\r\n2D Shapes\r\nThis environment is a 5\u00d7 5 grid world with 5 different objects placed at random positions. Each location can only be occupied by at maximum one object. Each object is represented by a unique shape/color combination, occupying 10\u00d7 10 pixels on the overall 50 \u00d7 50 pixel grid. At each time step, one object can be selected and moved by one position along the four cardinal directions. See Figure ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| for an example. The action has no effect if the target location in a particular direction is occupied by another object or outside of the 5\u00d7 5 grid. Thus, a learned transition model needs to take pairwise interactions between object properties (i.e., their locations) into account, as it would otherwise be unable to predict the effect of an action correctly.\r\n\r\n3D Blocks\r\nTo investigate to what degree our model is robust to partial occlusion and perspective changes, we implement a simple block pushing environment using Matplotlib hunter2007matplotlib as a rendering tool.

Learning such a structured world model from raw sensory data remains a challenge. As a step towards this goal, we introduce Contrastivelytrained Structured W rld Models (C-SWMs). C-SWMs utilize a contrastive approach for representation learning in environments with compositional structure. We structure each state embedding as a set of object representations and their relations, modeled by a graph neural network. This allows objects to be discovered from raw pixel observations without direct supervision as part of the l arning process. We evaluate C-SWMs on compositional environments involving multiple interacting objects that can be manipulated independently by  n agent, simple Atari games, and a multi-object phys cs simulation. Our experiments demonstrate that C-SWMs can overcome limitations of models based on pixel reconstruction and outperform typical representatives of this model class in highl  structured environments, while learning interpretable object-based representations.
