An ontology language for ontology mediated query answering (OMQA-language) is universa  for a family of OMQA-languages if it is the most expressive one among this family. In this paper, we focus on three families of tra table OMQAlanguages, including first-order rewritable languages and languages whose data complexity of the query answering is in ||SYMBOLTOKEN|| or PTIME. On the negative side, we prove that there is, in general, no universal language for each of these families of languages. On the positive side, we propose a novel property, the locality, to approximate the first-order rewritability, and show that there exists a language of disjunctive em edded dependencies that is universal for the family of OMQA-languages with locality. All of these results apply to OMQA with query languages such as conjunctive queries, unions of conjunctive queries and acyclic conjunctive queries.
